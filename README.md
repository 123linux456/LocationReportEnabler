LocationReportEnabler
=====================

A simple android app to enable Google Location Report, Google Now and related functions in China.

*ROOT REQUIRED*

*I hava found an issue abount Google Maps and its satellite view, no matter which one is correct and the other must be wrong. If someone finds the way to solve it, please contact me or reply in issue #2*

The only thing the app does is set 3 variables about sim card once the device boot completed.

+ set gsm.sim.operator.numeric to 310004
+ set gsm.sim.operator.iso-country to us
+ set gsm.sim.operator.alpha to Verizon

Some other apps have the same function set the other 3 variables gsm.operator.numeric, gsm.operator.iso-country and gsm.operator.alpha. 
This will disable the loation correction of Google Maps so that it wil have a so-called Chinese error. So I write this.
